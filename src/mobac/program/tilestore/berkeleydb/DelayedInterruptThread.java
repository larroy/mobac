/**
 * The Berkeley DB has some problems when someone interrupts the thread that is
 * currently performing IO activity. Therefore before executing any DB we allow
 * to disable the {@link #interrupt()} method via {@link #pauseInterrupt()}.
 * After the "interrupt sensitive section" {@link #resumeInterrupt()} restores
 * the regular behavior. If the thread has been interrupted while interrupt was
 * disabled {@link #resumeInterrupt()} catches up this.
